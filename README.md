# Stack-and-Queque
A form application designed to practice abstract data structures. C# visual programming is used in this application.

This form application consists of two parts. a stack of books is simulated on the left. on the right, people's work queues and waiting times are calculated.

*The first thing I did while making the application was to plan and design the application.*
I used a groupbox on the left and right and then placed the other tools under these groups.
I used seven "labels", a "listbox", two "textboxe", two "buttons" and a "numericupdown" in the left part.
I used eight " labels", a "listbox", twos "textbox", two "buttons" and a "numericupdown" in the right part.
